Interesting items    
    [ ] Show the total space in the upper right
    [ ] Show/Hide System files (Give the user hints on files they probably should not delete)
    [ ] Detect duplicate files
    [ ] Yes/No show free space
    [ ] Show mini pie chart indicating size of current view compared to the disk
    [ ] Add a tooltip that follows the mouse around and displays the same folder name and size data which currently appears only at the bottom of the screen.
    [ ] Sometimes if a folder is thousands of times bigger than its siblings the siblings are not visible in the graphical display. To get around that, it'd be cool if you could right click a huge folder, see a list of its siblings, select a sibling and have the tool shift focus to that sibling, just as if I HAD been able to see it in the graphic display and had clicked on it.
    [ ] When displaying labels, let me rotate the chart, but keep the labels level. This could make it so the particular labels I'm interested in don't overwrite each other.


Maybe if more people ask ...
    [ ] Add zoom buttons in the middle (back, waaay back)
    [ ] Yes/No show “Reparse” points (Aka links, mappings, etc.)
    [ ] Make the status more visible
    [ ] show the hover text under the mouse cursor
    [ ] Double clicking should do something

    [ ] Add ability to open a powershell window
    [ ] Improve chart labeling
    [ ] Transactional delete
    [ ] Take snapshots and diff them
    [ ] Show a sorted directory list

    [ ] Get to vSlice from the Drive Properties dialog
    [ ] Create a plugin for home server
    [ ] Show utilization patterns to help put busy files on different spindles  (x2)
